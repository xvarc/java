i need robust testing using asserts. i don't want any print statements coming out.
work one by one and look at each function and work out how to assert and check it

check his checklist in the marking to see what he values.

Do something to check for bad inputs.

create a user interface .

go over the whole thing and see what is expected for the input and output and format of the program.

 As well as your program, you should submit a report which describes the stages of development,
  the design decisions you made, any refactoring you had to do,
   and any particularly interesting issues that arose during implementation.

   i can do this by just going through the whole thing and describing each little piece and complication.
