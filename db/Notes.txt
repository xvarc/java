print - table, db, record

clear table, db, current record

write file

i can do asserts on a read by just getting the record and checking it against a string i write in

check his checklist in the marking to see what he values.

Do something to check for bad inputs.

create a user interface .

 As well as your program, you should submit a report which describes the stages of development,
  the design decisions you made, any refactoring you had to do,
   and any particularly interesting issues that arose during implementation.

   i can do this by just going through the whole thing and describing each little piece and complication.
