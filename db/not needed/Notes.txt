do the write up. find out how to submit properly.

As well as your program, you should submit a report which describes the stages of development,
 the design decisions you made, any refactoring you had to do,
  and any particularly interesting issues that arose during implementation.

  i can do this by just going through the whole thing and describing each little piece and complication.

check the feedback he gave me for my last one. 

mention that i use asserts

explain how to use my Programming

explain any design desicions i made

explain how to use my extension .

check his checklist in the marking to see what he values.
